            Given a list of tiles, determine if the N-puzzle is solvable.
            You do not need to know how to do this, but the calculation
            is based on the inversion order.

            for each number in the list of tiles,
               How many following numbers are less than that one
               e.g. [13, 10, 11, 6, 5, 7, 4, 8, 1, 12, 14, 9, 3, 15, 2, None]
               Example:  Files following 9:  [3, 15, 2, None]
               Two of these are smaller than 9, so the inversion order
                   for 9 is 2

            A puzzle's inversion order is the sum of the tile inversion
            orders.  For puzzles with even numbers of rows and columns,
            the row number on which the blank resides must be added.
            Note that we need not worry about 1 as there are
            no tiles smaller than one.

            This lets us know if a problem can be solved.  The inversion
            order modulo 2 is invariant across moves.  This means that
            when we make a legal move, the inversion order will always
            be even or odd.  The solution state always has an even
            inversion order, so any puzzle with an odd inversion
            number cannot be solved.
